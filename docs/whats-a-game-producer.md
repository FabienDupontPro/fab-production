description: The Gaming Industry's Most Misunderstood Role.
---

If you ask three game developers to define what a producer does, you will likely get four different answers. The title "Producer" in gaming is about as specific as saying someone "works with computers." Despite being crucial to game development, the producer role remains confusing, inconsistent, and full of misconceptions.

## Not All Producers Are Created Equal

The gaming industry has developed many different producer roles:

- **Publishing Producers** oversee relationships between developers and publishers, ensuring milestones are met and budgets maintained.
- **Content Producers** focus on creative output, working closely with designers and artists to deliver game features.
- **Technical Producers** specialize in coding pipelines and technical development processes.
- **Live Ops Producers** manage games after release, planning updates and events to keep players engaged.

This diversity exists because studios shape producer roles according to their specific needs rather than following industry standards.

## Project Manager? Product Owner? Team Lead?

Walk into any studio and "Producer" might mean:

Someone who manages project timelines and resources like a traditional project manager.

A product visionary who prioritizes features and represents player interests, similar to a product owner in other industries.

A people manager who supervises teams and helps with career development.

Sometimes one producer does all three, while other studios split these responsibilities among multiple people with the same title.

## How Is The Production Structured at Wargaming

At Wargaming, production on World of Tanks (PC) is set up to handle the demands of live service development. Other games at the company follow different structures, but this is how it works on Tanks.

There are about 15 producers, each responsible for a different part of the game. They work more like product managers than project managers. Their focus is on making sure their features have a real impact on the business and feel right for players.

Each producer partners with a dedicated project manager who handles planning and daily coordination. That lets producers stay focused on the big decisions.

They figure out which features are worth building, how to prioritize them, and where to invest limited resources. They keep an eye on what moves the needle for the game while still respecting what players care about.

Itâ€™s a setup that works well for a big, complex free-to-play game that needs to keep evolving without losing its balance.

## The Hierarchy Question

To add another layer of complexity, producers come with ranks:

**Executive Producers** typically oversee multiple projects or an entire studio's output. They handle high-level decisions about budgets and strategic direction.

**Producers manage** individual games or major components of larger titles.

**Associate Producers** support producers with specific tasks and learn the ropes.

These titles can indicate seniority, but the actual responsibilities vary tremendously between companies.

## Why Does This Matter?

This inconsistency creates real problems. New industry entrants struggle to understand career paths. Studios have trouble finding the right producers because job descriptions mean different things to different people. And producers themselves often find their skills don't transfer neatly between companies.

## What Makes a Good Producer?

Despite these differences, successful producers share key traits:

- Communication skills that bridge technical and creative teams
- Problem-solving abilities that unblock development
- Organizational talents that keep complex projects on track
- Adaptability to quickly changing circumstances
- Leadership qualities that motivate teams without direct authority

## Conclusion

The next time someone tells you they're a game producer, you might need to ask follow-up questions to understand what they actually do. This ambiguity isn't necessarily bad. It allows the role to evolve alongside the rapid changes in game development.
But it does mean we should approach the title with curiosity rather than assumptions. The producer working on your favorite game might be a scheduling wizard, a creative director in disguise, or a technical coordinator keeping the development engine running smoothly.
