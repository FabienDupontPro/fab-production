# Going From Junior to Senior Producer

Becoming a senior producer takes more than time. You need specific skills and must avoid common traps. I made plenty of mistakes on my way up, so let me save you some pain.

## Junior Producer Traps

Here are three mistakes most new producers make:

**1. Loving process more than results**

You spend hours making perfect JIRA boards, detailed plans nobody follows, or hunting for the ideal retrospective method.

Focus on what creates real value instead. Good work done often beats perfect work done rarely.

**2. Being a human router**

Many junior producers just pass information around without thinking about it. They know a lot but add little value.

Make sure you understand what info means and who truly needs it before sending it on.

**3. Being too cheery**

Always smiling and joking can lift spirits, but don't use good vibes to cover up real issues. 

Know when to stop the jokes and address serious problems head on.

## Stop Waiting for Instructions

Junior producers often sit around waiting to be told what to do. They don't drive topics, push for change, or prevent problems.

When I was new, I asked senior producers how to get better. They just said, "It comes with experience." Not helpful!

While experience matters, here's how to learn faster:

- **Steal others' experience**: Ask teammates about their past mistakes. Join online producer groups where people share war stories. Benjamin Carcich's Building Better Games Discord has great discussions.
- **Read game postmortems**: Someone has made your future mistakes already. Game Developer has tons of postmortems showing what went right and wrong on real projects.
- **Get a mentor**: Find a seasoned producer who can show you the ropes, walk through tricky situations, and share shortcuts they learned the hard way.

## Better Goals

Use SMART goals to make real progress:

- **Specific:** Don't say "communicate better." Say "write clearer meeting agendas."
- **Measurable:** Track concrete numbers. How often? How much? How long?
- **Actionable:** Focus on what YOU control, not what depends on others.
- **Relevant:** Make sure each goal helps you, your team, and your project.
- **Time-Based:** Set clear deadlines to create urgency.

Also:
- Schedule regular check-ins with your boss
- Have backup plans when things change
- Keep evidence of your progress for review time

## Make Retrospectives Work

Retrospectives help teams improve when done right. Avoid these mistakes:

- **Changing format every time**: Pick a format and stick with it for several sessions before trying something new.
- **Taking on all the work yourself**: The whole team should fix process problems, not just you. When producers do all the fixing, teams stop caring about how work happens.
- **Always running the show**: Take turns hosting so you can be a participant too. Retros aren't complaint sessions aimed at you, they're team improvement tools.
- **Bad timing**: Find the right frequency. Too often means improvements don't have time to work. Too rare means problems fester.

## Daily Habits of Great Producers

The best producers I know do these things:

- **Play the game**: Stay connected to the player experience. Know how development decisions affect the game.
- **Handle important but not urgent stuff**: Block time for these tasks before they become emergencies.
- **Treat everything like it ships tomorrow**: This ensures quality work and thorough planning.
- **Stay close to your team**: Regular check-ins help you spot issues with morale and progress.
- **Make standups about planning**: Focus on the day ahead, not just status reports.
- **Think before interrupting**: Ask if it can wait before breaking someone's focus. Most things aren't truly urgent.
- **Keep a good task list**: Whether paper or digital, maintain a current, prioritized list of what needs doing.

## Growing Up

As you move from junior to senior producer, you'll shift from following processes to creating them, from executing plans to building them, and from handling information to generating insights.

Great producers don't just know about methodologies. They help teams deliver awesome games while growing skills and avoiding burnout.

Production is a craft like any other in game development. It takes practice, reflection, and constant improvement. Be patient with yourself, learn from mistakes, and keep pushing to get better.
