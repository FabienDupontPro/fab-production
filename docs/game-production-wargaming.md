# Inside the Production Machine: How World of Tanks is Made

World of Tanks has stayed relevant for over a decade, which is rare in the crowded free-to-play world. That kind of staying power doesn’t happen by chance. It takes a production setup built to handle both the business side and the player experience. Here’s a look at how that works behind the scenes.

## Streams: More Than Just Task Lists

In many studios, a “stream” means a list of tasks or a backlog. At Wargaming, a stream is a real team. Each one is focused on a specific part of the game, and a producer owns that stream, not by managing the people directly, but by guiding what they deliver.

Functional leads handle the day-to-day people management. That way, producers can focus on direction and results. Still, motivating the team and supporting them is a big part of the job. Leading without formal authority means you need trust, clarity, and persistence.

## The Producer-Project Manager Duo

At the core of World of Tanks production is the relationship between producers and project managers.

Producers own the business outcomes. They decide what features to build, what order to tackle them in, and where to invest. If a feature doesn't deliver, it’s on the producer.

Project Managers keep the machine running. They handle capacity, scheduling, and delivery. If a feature ships late, they take the heat. If it ships on time but flops, that’s the producer’s problem.

## Feature Owners: Creative Leads

In World of Tanks team, most feature owners are game designers. Their job is to dream big and design fun, impactful features without worrying (too much) about constraints.

Producers then act as a filter. They weigh business impact, development costs, and player value. Some features get the green light. Others don’t.

## What a Stream Team Looks Like

Each stream is a cross-discipline team that might include one or multiple:

- Project manager
- Game designer
- UI and/or UX designer
- System designer
- Solution architect
- Front-end/Web developer
- QA manager
- And more (Monetization designer, Level designer, Server programmer, etc.)

Team members still report to their functional departments, but producers decide what they work on and when. This setup allows specialization while still moving as one unit.

## Shared Support

Some teams work across multiple streams. This includes analytics, art, audio, and animation.

They aren’t embedded in any one stream. Producers need to plan ahead to use their time. That keeps the core teams lean while giving streams access to expert help when needed.

## External Support

World of Tanks also brings in outside help through specific roles:

- **Outsource Managers** handle contracts and vendor coordination. External work is limited as World of Tanks needs deep domain knowledge.
- **QA Outsource** adds testing power. A common benchmark: one in-house QA is worth about three external testers.
- **Technical Art Outsource** helps manage spikes in production without growing the team full-time.

## Where Art Meets Operations

This structure keeps things running smoothly. Producers bridge the gap between creativity and business. They don’t manage everyone, but they set direction and shape what gets made.

The beauty of it? When it works, players never see it. They just get new content, regular updates, and a game that keeps evolving without losing what made it special in the first place.
