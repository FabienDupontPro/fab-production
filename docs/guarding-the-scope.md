# Guardians of the Scope

People see producers as the bad guys who tell teams to cut features. That's partly true, but not the whole story.

This job goes beyond hitting deadlines and budgets. We protect our teams from overwork and burnout. We help create sustainable work habits. When we cut scope, we're looking out for our people as much as our timelines.

This balance matters most in free to play games, where you need both quality at launch and energy to keep improving for years.

## How to Cut Right

When cuts need to happen, here's what works:

**1. Cut whole features, not bits and pieces**

Small cuts across many areas don't help much and can hurt quality everywhere. Focus on removing entire features instead. This gives clear direction and keeps what remains at high quality.

**2. Cutting takes work too**

Removing features means cleaning up code, changing assets, and fixing docs. Plan time for this cleanup.

**3. Watch for story holes**

Cut a feature and you might leave a gap in your game. Often your writers have to fix these gaps. Think about these ripple effects before finalizing cuts.

**4. Tell everyone what's gone**

Make sure the whole team knows what got cut. Nothing wastes more time than someone working on a feature that got axed weeks ago.

Cutting is a tool. Use it wisely, considering both the schedule and your team's health.

## Setting Real Expectations

Much of a producer's job comes down to managing expectations. Avoid these common mistakes:

**1. Ignoring risks**

When you don't identify and share risks, people make choices without seeing the full picture. Always discuss what could go wrong and how you'll handle it.

**2. Promising too much**

Learn when to say no. Success comes from promising less than you deliver, not the other way around.

**3. Planning poorly**

Too much planning kills flexibility. Too little leads to scope creep. Find the right balance for your project stage.

**4. Creating useless process**

Don't make processes just to feel organized. Start with minimal structure and add only what proves necessary.

**5. Missing the big picture**

Keep long term goals in mind while solving today's problems. Make sure quick fixes align with where you want to go.

**6. Skipping accountability**

Track progress in both conversations and writing. Note what's on track, what's going wrong, surprise work items, tradeoffs made, and scope creep.

Never assume everyone knows the same things. Repeat key information until it sticks.

## Measure What Matters

We track what we care about, but soon we start caring too much about what we track.

Game development has no progress bar showing you're 73% done. Good data is hard to find amid subjective calls, rough estimates, and shifting priorities.

People say "what gets measured gets improved." True, but are you measuring what matters?

Here are three approaches that help me navigate game development metrics:

**1. Let data inform, not control**

Use metrics as a starting point to dig deeper, not as the final word that dictates decisions.

**2. Some important things resist measurement**

Just because something is hard to measure doesn't make it less important. Player fun, team morale, and game feel matter hugely but don't fit neat metrics.

**3. Trust quality over quantity**

Numbers tell part of the story, but conversations, playtests, and watching players often reveal more truth.

Always talk with your teams to find root causes behind the numbers, and ask how they feel about your conclusions.

## Scope Equals Care

In free to play games, scope management isn't just about shipping version 1.0. It's about sustainable development that can run for years. Every feature you add becomes something you must maintain, balance, and possibly expand later.

Good producers see scope not as a limitation but as a focusing tool that helps teams make polished, coherent games. Clear boundaries actually boost creativity within those limits.

Your job guarding the scope isn't just saying no. It's helping the team find the best version of the game possible within your constraints. Sometimes that means cutting, but it always means caring about both the game and the people making it.
