Producers often get cast as the bad guy—the one who has to tell the team to cut features or assets. While that's partly true, there's more to it. My previous manager Lisa Kretschmer described producers as "Guardians of the Scope," and I love this framing.

This view expands our responsibility beyond just shipping on time and within budget. We're also ensuring the team isn't overwhelmed, doesn't burn out, and can maintain sustainable development practices. Cutting scope becomes as much about protecting your team as it is about hitting deadlines.

This balance is especially critical in free-to-play games, where you need both initial quality and the capacity to keep improving the game over its lifetime.

## The Art of the Cut

When you do need to make cuts, here's what I've learned:

**1. Cut at the team level, not the individual level**

Small reductions across many areas have minimal impact and can lower overall quality. Instead, focus cuts on entire features or content areas. This gives clear direction and preserves quality in what remains.

**2. Remember that cutting isn't free**

There's still work involved in removing references in code, changing assets, and updating documentation. Plan for this cleanup time when making cuts.

**3. Mind the narrative holes**

When you cut a feature, you leave a gap in your game. Often it's your narrative team that has to stitch this hole closed. Understand the ramifications of your cuts before finalizing decisions.

**4. Communicate cuts clearly**

Make sure everyone knows what's been cut. It's incredibly wasteful to have someone continue working on a feature that was removed from scope a month ago.

Cutting is a powerful tool in a producer's toolkit. Use it responsibly, with an eye toward both the schedule and the team's wellbeing.

## Managing Expectations

A large part of a producer's job is managing expectations. Here are common missteps to avoid:

**1. Skipping risk analysis**

When you don't analyze and communicate risks, people make decisions without understanding potential consequences. Always identify what could go wrong and how you'll handle it.

**2. Over-committing**

Learn to say "no" when necessary. The surest path to success is under-promising and over-delivering, not the other way around.

**3. Planning too much or too little**

Too much planning limits flexibility, while too little leads to scope creep. Find the right balance for your project phase.

**4. Creating process for process's sake**

Don't implement processes to make yourself feel organized. Start with minimal process and build only what proves necessary.

**5. Losing focus**

Always keep the big picture in mind while solving immediate problems. Make sure short-term solutions align with long-term goals.

**6. Lacking accountability frameworks**

Track progress consistently, both verbally and in writing. Note what's on track, what's going wrong, any unaccounted work, trade-offs made, and out-of-scope requests.

And never assume everyone is on the same page—repeat important information to make sure it lands.

## Measuring What Matters

We want to measure what we care about, but in doing so, we often start caring about what we're measuring—sometimes too much.

Tracking progress in game development is incredibly hard. Games don't have a simple progress bar showing you're 73% finished. Good data is difficult to come by, with subjectivity, uncertain estimates, and constantly changing priorities.

There's a saying often attributed to Peter Drucker: "What gets measured gets improved." This is generally true, but are you measuring the right things?

Here are three approaches that help me navigate the murky waters of game development metrics:

**1. Be data-informed, not data-driven**

Use data as a starting point for deeper investigation, not as the final word that dictates decisions.

**2. Beware the quantitative fallacy**

Just because something is hard to measure doesn't mean it's not important. Player enjoyment, team morale, and game feel matter enormously but resist simple metrics.

**3. Value qualitative over quantitative when in doubt**

Numbers tell part of the story, but conversations, playtests, and observations often reveal what's really happening.

Always talk with your teams to find underlying causes behind the numbers, and ask how they feel about your conclusions.

## Scope Management is Team Care

In free-to-play games, scope management isn't just about the initial release—it's about sustainable development that can continue for years. Every feature you add is a feature you'll need to maintain, balance, and potentially expand upon later.

The best producers think of scope not as a limitation but as a focusing tool that helps teams create more polished, coherent games. By setting clear boundaries, you actually enable more creativity within those boundaries.

Remember that your job as the guardian of scope isn't just to say no—it's to help the team find the best possible version of the game that can be made within your constraints. Sometimes that means cutting, but it always means caring about both the game and the people making it.
