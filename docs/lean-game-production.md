# Cut the Crap: Game Dev Without the Bureaucracy BS

Too much process kills game production. Period. When teams get buried in bureaucracy, everything slows down and communication breaks. 

Here's the truth: you need just enough structure to keep things moving, nothing more. This matters most in free-to-play games where speed and adaptation win.

## Signs Your Team Is Drowning in Red Tape

Watch for these red flags:

1. **Nobody knows who decides anything**
2. **Tasks never finish** and roll over sprint after sprint
3. **Nothing moves without checking with five people first**
4. **No new ideas ever get tried**
5. **Small problems become team crises**
6. **Managers and teams fight over control**
7. **Dates matter more than what you ship**
8. **Everyone waits for orders instead of taking action**

Spot three or more? Time to simplify.

## Agile Is a Mindset, Not a Rulebook

Stop saying "we do Agile." That misses the point. Agile isn't something you follow, it's how you think.

Agile means learning fast and changing course based on what works. The rituals should help this, not become the goal.

I keep hearing, "We must do X because Agile says so." Wrong. Ask instead: What problem was this practice meant to solve? Do we have that problem? No? Then skip it.

## Rethink Your Meetings

Take daily standups. I haven't run one in years. Why? They wasted time. People said the same things every day.

As a Producer and Project Manager, I’ve tried different frequency. Once a week, twice a week, sometimes adding daily stand-ups during the final sprint of a big milestone. What I’ve learned is that the right frequency depends on the team and the project. There’s no one-size-fits-all, just what works here and now.

Of course these will never replace your weekly personal 1on1s, and that is a frequency I never changed and never heard any complains about.

For blockers, we use team chat. If something's stuck, I know right away what needs fixing.

Standups work for some teams. Great for them. But copy-pasting practices without thinking is not for me. Understand why each practice exists, then adapt it.

## Make Meetings Count

It's not just valid in Game Production, it's quite universal:

1. **Every invite needs a goal and agenda** or it gets declined
2. **Show up prepared** with all links and docs ready
3. **Write notes and follow up** so everyone stays aligned
4. **Make sure everyone talks** or why are they there?
A bonus one that I read somwhere:
5. **Schedule 25 or 50 minutes** instead of 30 or 60 to give people breathing room

And for meetings over 2 hours, bring food. Just do it.

## Process Serves the Game, Not the Other Way Around

Every procedure should help build a better game faster. Start with minimal process, add only what proves necessary.

Regularly ask: Does this still help or has it become an empty ritual?

For free-to-play games, you need light processes that let you pivot fast. Heavy processes from shipped products will kill your live service game.

Good process isn't about following frameworks. It's about helping your team make games players actually want to play.
