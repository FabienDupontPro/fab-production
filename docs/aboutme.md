For over ten years I've worked in the trenches of game publishing and development, most of that time at Wargaming. I started in customer service and climbed to Producer on World of Tanks, wearing many hats along the way.

This journey taught me what matters: people, purpose, and features players actually want. I don't get lost in fancy talk. I focus on results.

Live service games fascinate me. I've worked with designers, coders, analysts, testers, and marketers to build features that keep players coming back while meeting business needs. Good production finds that sweet spot between what players expect and what the company needs, both now and later.

My method works because it's simple. I give teams clear goals, tell them why it matters, then back off and let them shine. No hovering, no micromanaging. Just context, trust, and decisions based on real information from real people.

I know project management, live operations, and analytics. But I also know that process must serve people, not the other way around. Games succeed when the vision is clear, teams work together, and everyone can adapt when things change.

This blog shares what I've learned about making games: what works, what fails, and what still puzzles me. It's my notes, thoughts, and a conversation with anyone else figuring out this wild industry.
