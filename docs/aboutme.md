I'm a game producer with over a decade of experience working in the video game industry, most of it spent at Wargaming. I’ve worn a lot of hats over the years—customer service rep, team lead, project manager, department head, and most recently, producer on *World of Tanks*. That range of roles shaped the way I approach game development: with a clear focus on people, purpose, and delivering features that actually matter.

I’m especially interested in the mechanics behind live service games. I’ve worked closely with teams across disciplines—designers, programmers, analysts, QA, marketing—to ship features that keep players engaged while supporting business goals. I believe the real art of game production is in finding that balance, not just between player expectations and company needs, but between short-term fixes and long-term vision.

My approach is simple: give teams a clear goal, explain why it matters, and then give them the space to do great work. I don’t believe in micromanagement. I believe in context, trust, and making decisions based on real data and real conversations.

Along the way, I’ve picked up a strong foundation in project management methodologies, live ops, and product analytics. I’ve also learned that process only works if it serves the people using it—tools are just tools. What makes a game succeed is clarity of vision, cross-functional collaboration, and the ability to adapt.

This blog is a place for me to share what I’ve learned about game production: what works, what doesn’t, and what I’m still figuring out. It’s part notes, part reflection, and part open conversation with anyone else who’s navigating this strange and exciting industry.

If any of this resonates with you, feel free to reach out. I’m always up for a chat about production, live ops, or why feature scoping always takes longer than you think.
